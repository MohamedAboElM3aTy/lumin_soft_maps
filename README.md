# This Flutter app was built during my internship.
### This is a small version of the Uber app ... both Client and Driver apps.


## Task:

* My Task is to build two apps ... Client app and a driver app.
* I created the features as Flutter packages to be reusable in any project.
* I used Melos to handle the mono repo logic and implement two apps in the same repo.
* I used Open Map Street API to get the location and details I needed to store.
* I used Firebase Firestore to store the data.
* I separate the login logic if the user is a client or a driver. 
* I used cloud functions to handle the logic of sending a notification when doing a specific action in both apps.
* I used a mix of Firebase messaging and Flutter local notification to implement the notification logic in the app. 
* Allow the client and driver to have a chat with each other.
